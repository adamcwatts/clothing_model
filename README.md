# Heat and Mass Transport Fabric Model
1. Python script to model heat and mass transport through textiles. 
2. Functions.py script holds most of the common functions needed to run the model. Some of these functions include calculating saturated vapor pressure given a certain temperature [Â°C] or generating effective fabric properties from the constituent fibers.
3. MODEL_BC_IC.py script holds all the boundary and initial conditions needed to run the scripts. Also holds material parameters and physics parameters governing the system
